	<p>In this package we have an implementation of the iterator pattern using a menu system
		from two restaurants. The aggregates package contains the underlying collections
		and the iterators package conatains the differing implentations of the iteration
		algorithm. Please note that other than at the object construction the Waitress has no
		knowledge of the differing iterator implementations and thus also has no knowledge
		of the differing structures of the menu collections.</p>
	
	<p>The key thing to note from this pattern is that the iteration through the menu items is
		encapsulated away from the underlying menu and the API of the iteration is defined
		through an interface. Thus for any collection of objects a common algorithm can
		be used to move through the collection of objects.</p>
