	<p>In this package we demonstrate the observer pattern using a single subject (a weather
		station) and then set up a number of observers on this subject. I have deliberately
		stayed away from the Java Observer interface and Observable abstract class so that we
		can implement the raw underlying pattern.</p>
	
	<p>The key thing to note in this pattern is that the observaber can be updated with change
		information and the observerable has the ability to have observers regsiter with it
		so that they can be updated.</p>
