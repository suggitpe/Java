<body bgcolor="white"> This top level package contains example code for the structural
	patterns, ie those patterns that are used to form structured designs for differing
	problems. This package contains the following specific patterns.
	<ul>
		<li>Adapter pattern - this pattern is similar to the Decorator pattern in that it is
			about the wrapping of objects with others. The Decorator pattern wraps objects
			to extend their functionality whereas the adapter pattern wraps an object to
			hide its interface and expose a new (more desirable interface). This pattern is
			all about creating an object interface and then mapping it to another
			objects interface.</li>
		<li>Bridge pattern - </li>
		<li>Composite pattern - </li>
		<li>Decorator pattern - in this pattern we 'wrap' up an object with another instance
			of the same interface or abstract class. This is used when inheritance is too
			great a job (eg if there are too many posibilities) and thus an element of wrapping
			of an object is more powerfull than inheritance (can only inherit from one
			class). So for example if we have an object deriving from an interface containing
			a method called foo(), we then create a wrapper object that also derives from that
			object that will first call the inner foo() andthen its local impl of foo().</li>
		<li>Facade pattern - </li>
		<li>Flyweight pattern - </li>
		<li>Proxy pattern - </li>
	</ul>
