<body bgcolor="white"> This top level package contains example code for the creational
	patterns, ie those patterns that are used to instantiate other objects (or themselves).
	This package contains the following specific patterns.
	<ul>
		<li>Factory pattern - This implementation uses a Pizza Store as an example for the
			factory pattern. There is an abstract Pizza Store object that delegates the
			creation of Pizzas to the concrete Pizza Stores. It is in these stores that that
			factory methods are implemented. They will each take a string as a type to build
			and based on that type will build the correct type of Pizza. It is then up to
			the factory method to construct the correct Pizza type.</li>
		<li>Abstract Factory pattern - This implementation is a design to create a factory
			from a factory method. In other words this is a nested factory. The only key
			difference is that the underlying factory that is produced has a defined
			interface and thus is an abstact factory.</li>
		<li>Builder pattern - This implementation is vaguely simlar to the Factory Pattern
			with the exception that the builder pattern is all about delegating the
			construction of an object to an encapsualted object designed specifically for
			the purpose of building complex objects. So for example a builder could be used
			with a high level interface interacted to by a GUI to create custom user
			chosen objects in the GUI (or even a view).</li>
		<li>Singleton pattern - This implementation ensures that one and only one instance
			of a class exists at runtime. This is achieved by making the constructor private
			and setting up a static method that will look for an internal static 'instance'
			variable constructing where necessary (implementation of a lazy object
			instantiation and thus is efficient). Thus only one instance of the variable
			should exist for the application. NB, make sure that the internal instance
			variable is constructed in a thread safe way (use syncronized block on a non
			thread-local (ie declare the variable volatile) variable. Also be aware that if
			two different classloaders load up a singleton then you could end up with two
			different instances of the singleton (remedy woudl be to create a custom
			classloader)</li>
		<li>Prototype pattern - This implementation takes the pain of constructing large
			numbers of similar objects away from the program. Instead a template object is
			created that is then cloned and then modified as many times as felt
			necessary for the application.</li>
	</ul>
